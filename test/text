Double Quotes ("..."): 
The preprocessor first searches the same directory as the source file, then the standard directories.
Angle Brackets (<...>): 
The preprocessor searches only in the standard directories pre-designated by the compiler.

Avoiding Dangling Pointers:
After freeing memory, set the pointer to NULL to avoid accidental dereferencing:
free(a);
a = NULL;

Preventing Memory Leaks:
Ensure every malloc (or similar allocation function) has a corresponding free:
int *a = (int *)malloc(sizeof(int));
// use the allocated memory
free(a); // free the allocated memory when done
Use tools like Valgrind to detect memory leaks and dangling pointers in your programs.\


This ensures that the macro arguments are correctly grouped. However, to fully avoid side effects,
you should use inline functions or standard functions instead of macros:
Using an inline function guarantees that the argument is only evaluated once.
